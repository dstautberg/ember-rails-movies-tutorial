Movies Ember Exercise
=====================

Build a movies website using ember. Tasks are provided in the form of story
cards.

Setup
-----
```
rake db:setup
```

rails server

Instructions
------------

On starting rails server the application will be availalble here:

http://localhost:3000

Click on the cards link on the top right of the screen to see what needs doing.
Mark cards as done as you work through them using the "Details" link.

Need extra help? Each card has 3 clues that can be accessed through Details page

Chrome is probably the easiest browser for this as it you can install the Ember
Inspector, and it supports the placement of breakpoints by placing the word
'debugger' in the code.

Ember documentation
-------------------

Ember itself has documentation in the Ember Guides:

http://emberjs.com/guides/


Also ember-data is used for persistnace to the fixtures/database. This page is
particularly helpful for figuring out how to save, create records, work with
promises, etc:
